Hi, I am [Yuvraj](https://evalsocket.dev) üß¢, A Generalist situated in the scenic Dhauladhar Mountain Range ü§ü of India ‚õ∞Ô∏è. I love OpenSource and have worked and contributed to several projects over the past few years. The most well-known project I contributed is [Flyte](https://flyte.org), [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) and [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco).

<br>
In late 2012, I stumbled upon the Internet and realised the disruptive potential of being able to build and publish websites. Since that day, I have been immersed in daily learning about the Internet in its broadest sense. The world of computers brings me joy and excitement
