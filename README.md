**"I've watched talent get overlooked for politics.**  
**I've seen merit lose to manipulation.**  
**I've witnessed brilliance dimmed by bias.**

I learned that sometimes they choose comfort over competence,  
relationships over results, politics over performance.

But here's what they don't understand:  
You can reject me, but you can't reject my code running in production.  
You can ignore my resume, but you can't ignore my contributions.  
You can question my background, but you can't question my results.

I build because I must. I contribute because I care. I persist because I know.  
One day, the systems I build will be too big to ignore.  
One day, the impact I make will speak louder than any interview.

**Until then, I code.**
